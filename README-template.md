## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- [ChartJs](https://www.chartjs.org)
You don't need React for this project.

### What I learned

I know this a small project, but dealing with ChartJs and its integration with website is good to know.

I learned how to make a chart responsive corresponding to screen size.After all a nice cool project...
